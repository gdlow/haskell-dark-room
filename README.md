# haskell-dark-room
CLI interactive terminal implementation of the Youtube/Fringe Hit "The Dark Room". Experimentation with IO and Control.Concurrent module.

**TO RUN**:

In Docker: `docker build -t "haskell-dark-room" .` `docker run -it haskell-dark-room`

In ghci: `runhaskell darkroom.hs`

Note that the compiled version of the program will not output text letter by letter aesthetically as compared to doing `runhaskell foo.hs`
